##Thanks
- Thanks to [Ershad Kunnakkadan](http://ershadk.com/) for helping me out in learning Ruby and Rails. Also, I took many of the concepts from his GSoC project [Grandham](https://github.com/smc/grandham) which was done under [Swathanthra Malayalam Computing](http://smc.org.in/). So, special thanks for that too. :)
- Also, all the guys who made Internet the best teacher out there, thanks and kudos to you. :)

                            Abstract
A Content Management System (CMS) is a combination of large
database and file system which are used to store and later retrieve
huge amounts of data. At the college level, the Library Content
Management System stores and manages the collegeâ€™s electronic
documents, journals, magazines and other resources so that the
students and faculty members of the college can reuse the
information across different applications. It is used to organize and
facilitate collaborative content creation. The basic idea behind a
Library CMS is to separate the content management from design.
Page designs are stored in templates while the content may be 
stored in a database or separate files. The benefits a Library CMS
offers are both for website administrators and authors. A Library
CMS allows students and professors to easily and quickly access
the resources. A Library CMS establishes defined publishing
processes and specific publishing rights to various individuals.
These entire facilities make the users save the time for training,
facilitate more people to access the resources whenever
and wherever they want.


                  BASE IDEA.
This Library Content Management System project is based on the
management of the contents and resources of a library. This Library
Content Management System Software has been designed and developed
to fulfil all the requirements and needs for archiving the resources of a
library. Content Management System (CMS) is a computer program that
allows publishing, editing and modifying content as well as
maintenance from central interface. This Library CMS is used to run the
official Library Content Management System website which will contain
the articles, news, blogs and notifications about the library and its
resources. This website enables the Library to avoid the need of hand
coding and support it for specific elements or entire pages. It will enable
the preservation of books and resources, provides security in case of
disaster, as well as includes functions such as Web Based Publishing,
Format Management, Revision and Version Control, indexing, searching
and retrieval. The Library Content Management software, as a final
product, will allow for the digitalization and archiving of magazines,
digital video and audio materials so that the users may annotate, analyse,
evaluate and share materials. It can be accessed anytime and anywhere
