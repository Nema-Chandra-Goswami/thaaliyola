##Thanks
- Thanks to [Ershad Kunnakkadan](http://ershadk.com/) for helping me out in learning Ruby and Rails. Also, I took many of the concepts from his GSoC project [Grandham](https://github.com/smc/grandham) which was done under [Swathanthra Malayalam Computing](http://smc.org.in/). So, special thanks for that too. :)
- Also, all the guys who made Internet the best teacher out there, thanks and kudos to you. :)
